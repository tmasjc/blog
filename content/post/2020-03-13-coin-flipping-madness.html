<p>From 538’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-flip-your-way-to-victory/">The Riddler</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have two fair coins, labeled A and B. When you flip coin A, you get 1 point if it comes up heads, but you lose 1 point if it comes up tails. Coin B is worth twice as much — when you flip coin B, you get 2 points if it comes up heads, but you lose 2 points if it comes up tails. </br></br>
To play the game, you make a total of 100 flips. For each flip, you can choose either coin, and you know the outcomes of all the previous flips. In order to win, you must finish with a positive total score. In your eyes, finishing with 2 points is just as good as finishing with 200 points — any positive score is a win. (By the same token, finishing with 0 or −2 points is just as bad as finishing with −200 points.) </br></br>
If you optimize your strategy, what percentage of games will you win? (Remember, one game consists of 100 coin flips.)</p>

<pre class="r"><code>library(purrr)
library(furrr)

# flipping coin A or B with respective points
flip_coin &lt;- function(coin) {
    x = ifelse(rbinom(1, 1, 0.5), 1, -1)
    ifelse(coin == &quot;A&quot;, x * 1, x * 2)
}

# acc = accumulative score; i = remaining flip;
run_game &lt;- function(acc, i, threshold = 0) {
    
    # terminal condition
    if (i == 0) return(acc);
    
    ## this is our strategy: 
    ## only when we&#39;re behind taking risk makes a difference
    x = ifelse(acc &lt; threshold, flip_coin(&quot;B&quot;), flip_coin(&quot;A&quot;))
    
    run_game(acc + x, i - 1, threshold)
}

set.seed(1111)
trials = 3000
res = replicate(trials, run_game(0, 100))
sum(res &gt; 0) / trials # win game if positive</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.6366667</code></pre>
<p>The answer is <strong>64%</strong>. If you play the game the optimal way, you are able to win ~64% of the time. Here, we vary the threshold to adjust the strategy from conservative (-10) to aggresive mode (10). Also note that, if you choose your strategy to only play either coin A or coin B, your winning probability is only 46% instead of 50% (because zero is considered a loss).</p>

<p>For further analysis, we can explore the winning chances at any point of in the game. For an instance, if you are left with 10 flips and are 5 points behind, what are the odds of you winning the game at the end?</p>
<pre class="r"><code># create a data frame as grid for simulation
df &lt;- expand.grid(remaining = seq(10, 90, 10), acc = seq(-20, 20, 1))

# a point on grid represents a single possibility
# loop thru our grid to calc expected chances
res &lt;- future_map2_dbl(df$acc, df$remaining, ~ {
    sum(replicate(trials, run_game(.x, .y)) &gt; 0) / trials

<p>We use a heat map to illustrate this.</p>
