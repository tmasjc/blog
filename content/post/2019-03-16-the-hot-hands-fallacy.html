<p>Steph Curry averaging <strong>.411</strong> in 3-point field goal percentage during the 2016-17 season. On November 7 2016, he made 13 out of 17 3-point attemps. How likely was it to happen?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
set.seed(123)

# 3-point fg pct
steph_curry = 0.411

# simulation trials
trials = 10000

# simulate shot game in 17 attemps
made &lt;- replicate(trials, sum(rbinom(n = 17, size = 1, prob = steph_curry)))

# plot it out
made %&gt;% 
    as_data_frame() %&gt;% 
    ggplot(aes(made)) +
