<p>The origin of this question is an interview question from Google.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a village in which people only want boys every family continues to have children until they have a boy. If they have a girl, they have another child. If they have a boy, they stop. What is the expected boy to girl ratio in the village?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though this can be solved mathematically (of course it can), the question is (IMO) easier to solve by thinking in a tree/branches structure.</p>
<p>If we assume the village has N families, and the probability of having a boy or girl is 50/50, then</p>
<p><img src="/etc/village/diagramme.png" /></p>
<p>Here we see the obvious, as the depth of tree extends, the boy-to-girl disparity will ultimately become insignificant. Hence, the ratio will be very close to 50/50.</p>
<p>However, the question itself is not the main interest of this post. It turns out to be quite a nice practice for simulation coding. The following attaches the source code to the simulation as it validates the answer given above. I utilize both <strong>functional (higher order function)</strong> and <strong>dynamic programming</strong> here.</p>

simulate_once &lt;- function(N, verbose=FALSE) {
    
    # nobody has anything yet...
    boys  = 0; girls = 0;
    
    print_vars &lt;- function() {
        message(&quot;BGR:&quot;, boys, &quot;/&quot;, girls)
        message(&quot;==================&quot;)
    }
    
    tryonemore &lt;- function(x, msgON) {
        # browser()
        if(msgON) message(x)
        
        # terminal condition: all 1 (boys)
        if (all(x)) {
            boys  &lt;&lt;- boys + sum(x)
            if (msgON) print_vars()
            return(1)
        }
        
        # assign to parent env so that we can keep track
        boys  &lt;&lt;-  boys + sum(x)
        girls &lt;&lt;- girls + sum(!x)
        
        if (msgON) print_vars()
        return(tryonemore(rbinom(sum(!x), 1, 0.5), msgON = msgON))
    }
    # init call
    tryonemore(rbinom(N, 1, 0.5), msgON=verbose)
    return(boys / girls)
}
set.seed(1111)
