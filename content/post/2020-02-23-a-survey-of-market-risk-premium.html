<p>This is an exploratory analysis based on <a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=3358901">the paper</a> cited below. I am interested to explore the relationship of coefficient of variation (CV) between developed and developing countries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fernandez, Pablo and Martinez, Mar and Fernández Acín, Isabel, Market Risk Premium and Risk-Free Rate Used for 69 Countries in 2019: A Survey (March 23, 2019). Available at SSRN: <a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=3358901" class="uri">https://ssrn.com/abstract=3358901</a> or <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3358901" class="uri">http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3358901</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To classify countries into developed or developing status, I use a general rough guide where country with GDP per capita above 24000 is considered developed. Alternatively, I could use human development index (HDI) but the former is commonly used among many economists.</p>
