Dingtalk is the official comm tool in our work. They provide an interface which allow users to add robot to a group. A robot is merely a webhook that receives POST requests. More details can be found on docs. 

Here I use the signature method to provide extra security. For this method to work, we need 3 piece of information. Token (1) and secret (2) can be obtained from the webhook setting. Signing (3) process is demonstrated below. I attach both R and Python version.

Docs: https://ding-doc.dingtalk.com/doc#/serverapi2/krgddi

### R

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(digest)
library(magrittr)
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
library(glue)

# you need to obtain these from webhook setting
url    = "https://oapi.dingtalk.com/robot/send"
token  = "some-token"
secret = "some-secret"
ts     = round(as.numeric(Sys.time()) * 1000)

# obtain signature 
str  <- paste(ts, secret, sep = "\n")
hmc  <- digest::hmac(secret, str, algo = "sha256", raw = TRUE)
sign <- hmc %>% base64Encode() %>% URLencode(reserved = TRUE)
endp <- glue("{url}?access_token={token}&timestamp={ts}&sign={sign}")

# there are other types of body, RTD
body <- list(
    msgtype = "text",
    text = list(content = "周末写代码的愉悦大于一切")
)

# send to webhook 
POST(url = endp, body = body, encode = "json", verbose())
```

### Python3

```python3
import time
import hmac
import hashlib
import base64
import urllib
import requests

# https://oapi.dingtalk.com/robot/send?access_token=
url    = "https://oapi.dingtalk.com/robot/send"
token  = "some-token"
secret = "some-secret"
ts     = int(round(time.time() * 1000))

# obtain signature
str  = '{}\n{}'.format(ts, secret)
hmc  = hmac.new(secret.encode('utf-8'), str.encode('utf-8'), digestmod=hashlib.sha256).digest()
sign = urllib.parse.quote_plus(base64.b64encode(hmc))

# this is our request endpoint
endp = '{}?access_token={}&timestamp={}&sign={}'.format(url, token, ts, sign)

# send to webhook
body = {'msgtype':'text', 'text':{'content':'今日宜清空购物车'}}
r =  requests.post(url = endp, json = body)

# view response
print(r.text)
```
